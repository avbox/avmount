What is new in djmount 0.71

* fix: filter UPnP devices so that only MediaServers are listed e.g. UPnP 
  Routers are no longer visible (problem reported by Martin Vallevand). 

* fix: correctly handle UPnP devices with embedded sub-devices

* fix: memory corruption when discovering some UPnP devices

* fix: suppress error messages for missing optional elements in device 
  description (URLBase, presentationURL).

* fix: "make check" failures e.g. on Gentoo (fix by Thomas Sattler).

* try to accommodate broken UPnP devices who do not report the MIME type 
  of the Device description document as XML.

* add "text/plain" MIME type to be able to display .txt files

* minor documentation updates

* minor optimisations when analysing XML documents

* some code improvements and more unitary tests

============================================================================

What is new in djmount 0.70

* implement "search" operations (major evolution) : see examples in README
  and details in "search_help.txt" (also available at run-time in "_search/"
  sub-directories).

* reorganise directories to avoid clutter : only multimedia files are directly
  visible. Other items are moved in hidden directories : all metadata XML 
  files are now in sub-directories ".metadata", and debug information 
  (e.g. "status" files) are in "/.debug" directory.

* add some missing MIME types used by GeeXboX uShare

* improve network cache

* improve some error messages

* tested ok with Nokia N93 phone (reported by Sami Kyöstilä)

* code refactoring and miscellaneous code improvements

============================================================================

What is new in djmount 0.53

* allow the 'mmap' operation to succeed on exported files. This helps some
  media players to work with djmount e.g. mpg321 (problem reported by 
  Frank Scholz).
  Note: this works only if using FUSE >= 2.4. Also, this doesn't work with
  some (very rare) media servers who do not tell the size of exported files 
  (i.e. AV Media Server in Intel Tools).

============================================================================

What is new in djmount 0.52

* allow some extra FUSE-related mount options. Mainly : fsname, allow_other, 
  allow_root, nonempty

* adds backward compatibility with FUSE 2.2 (djmount 0.50 initially required 
  FUSE >= 2.4). This is to allow install on Debian Sarge with FUSE stable.

* if using external libupnp, requires at least version 1.3.1

============================================================================

What is new in 0.51

* fix major bug causing empty "browse" on some type of UPnP AV servers,
  for example AV Media Server in Intel Tools for UPnP Technologies
  (reported by Christian Fredrik Kalager Schaller)

* improve djmount freezing when trying to access unreachable Media Servers 
  e.g. behind a closed firewall.

  Note : if your UPnP Media Server is behind a closed firewall, it won't be 
  visible in djmount. Therefore, if there is a firewall on the machine
  where you are running your media server, you have to open the necessary
  ports in this firewall. Some media servers can do it automatically 
  (e.g. Windows Media Connect on Windows XP), most of them don't do it 
  (e.g. AV Media Server in Intel Tools).

* djmount now works ok with AV Media Server in Intel Tools for UPnP 
  Technologies (.NET) (Build 1768)

* tested ok with latest releases of the following Media Servers :
  TwonkyVision UPnP Music Server 3.0, GMediaServer 0.9.0, GeeXboX uShare 0.9.5

* fix configure problem when building with FUSE 2.5.0

* fix warnings when building with gcc4 (tested ok on Ubuntu 5.10, gcc 4.0.2)

* force playlist mode for AV files of unknown sizes (streams, or size 
  not provided by server).

* add matroska and ogg MIME types

* miscellaneous bug fixes

============================================================================

What is new in 0.50

* major change : the content of all files is now directly shared by djmount,
  instead of playlists e.g. MP3 files are directly visible, instead of M3U 
  files. This allow : 
    - seeking A/V files in media players not supporting seeks in HTTP streams,
    - accessing files without playlist formats e.g. images.
  Known limitation : files larger than 2 Gb are not always treated correctly.

  The old djmount behaviour (sharing of playlists) can still be obtained using
  the "-o playlists" mount option (only for A/V files though).

  Note: this change requires using FUSE >= 2.4

* configure: add new --disable-charset option to suppress all character 
  conversion code (i.e. assume everything is in UTF-8)

* fix crash when browsing GeeXboX uShare 0.9.3 (empty directory name)

* fix potential corruption of filenames with international characters

* fix: relative paths to mount points are now working in daemon mode 
  (reported by Andre Landwehr)

* code refactoring and miscellaneous code improvements.

============================================================================

What is new in 0.40

* new build system : standard autoconf + automake support for all packages,
  including bundled libupnp.

* tested ok with GeeXboX uShare ( http://ushare.geexbox.org/ )

* fix: additional checks and logs for devices with incorrect ServiceType 
  or ServiceId values

============================================================================

What is new in 0.31

* fix small memory leak when reading '/devices' file

* include additional debugging information in 'status' files, 
  to help diagnostic in case of failure

* updated README to indicate that djmount has been tested ok with 
  FUSE 2.4.0, Windows Media Connect, Nero MediaHome

============================================================================

What is new in 0.30

* full i18n charset support, either with iconv (when available), or internally
  (limited to utf8 and 8bits charsets cpxxx and iso-8859-xxx).

* fix running in daemon mode (default if not -f or -d flag)
  (bug reported by Benjamin Zores)

* fix discovery of new device when DeviceType is empty

* fix printing of UPnP port number after initialisation 
  (bug reported by Benjamin Zores)

* add colorization of debug log output, depending on severity

============================================================================

What is new in 0.26

* makes the XML parser more tolerant to malformed text, 
  in order to improve interoperability with non strictly compliant devices.

============================================================================

What is new in 0.25

* preliminary i18n charset support 
  (supports 8bits charsets iso-8859-x and CPxxx)

* tested on Linux with TwonkyVision UPnP Music Server and GMediaServer 

============================================================================

What is new in 0.20

* Network caching has been implemented for basic browsing,
  so performances for large media collections are a lot better.

* Internal code improvments

* Still only tested with TwonkyVision UPnP Music Server.

============================================================================

What is new in 0.10

* first (alpha) release

* Basic browsing is implemented, but there is no network caching yet, 
  so browsing large media collections can be quite slow.

* Only tested with TwonkyVision UPnP Music Server.
