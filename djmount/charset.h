/*
 * Different character sets are used in djmount :
 *	- UPnP encoding, as used in libupnp
 *	- internal encoding, as used in djmount C code,
 *	- display encoding, for filenames provided to FUSE and VFS
 *
 * UPnP charset
 * ------------
 *	UPnP messages are sent and received in UTF-8.
 *	Although this is not mandatory in "UPnP Device Architecture" v1.0,
 *	this is clearly required in "UPnP Device Architecture v1.0.1 Draft"
 *	(see http://www.upnp.org/resources/documents.asp ). 
 *	Furthermore, the "libupnp" implementation assume UTF-8 in its code.
 * 
 * Internal charset
 * ----------------
 *	The internal character set used in djmount C code must meet the 
 *	following constraints:
 *	  - respects '\0' and '/' characters (assumed in various functions),
 *	  - more generally, respects ASCII characters (assumed in definitions
 *	    of constant strings e.g. printf formats).
 *	These constraints rule out usage of multi-byte encoding not compatible 
 *	with ASCII characters (like UTF-16). Instead, UTF-8 or 8-bits
 *	encodings (e.g. ISO-8859-xxx, CPxxx) should be used.
 *	To avoid unnecessary conversions with the UPnP layer, the internal
 *	charset selected in djmount C code is UTF-8.
 *
 * Display charset
 * ---------------
 *	This character set is used principally for filenames received from 
 *	or sent to the FUSE / VFS layer.
 *	The charset is selected according to user preferences
 *	(e.g. locale of user starting djmount), although obviously any
 *	encoding not compatible with ASCII will not really work
 *	(because of '\0' and '/' assumptions in FUSE or VFS).
